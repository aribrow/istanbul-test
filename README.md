This is a test <strong>SAPUI5</strong> project implementing <strong>grunt-qunit-istanbul</strong> for generating <strong>lcov</strong> reports.

In this scenario, the JS file in the test page is being included with the <strong><em>jQuery.sap.require()</em></strong> command and the test task breaks. If the file is included with the < script > tag in the head of the HTML, the test works.

- In order to run the project for the first time, enter <strong><em>npm install</em></strong>.<br />
- To run the tests just enter <strong><em>grunt test</em></strong> in the console.
